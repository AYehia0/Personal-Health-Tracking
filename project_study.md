 Intoduction : 
 
     abstract 

      Health tracking as a web application is an effictive method to keep you healthy, where you can add almost all the existing food
      and keep track of your daily calorie limit, the application helps track your weight, 
      which can be used by all ages, men/women, also you can create your own recipes.

 Objectives :

    ● Provide an easy way to manange your everyday meals.
    ● Count calories and keep track of weight loss process.
    ● Easy to use, access from anywhere.
    ● Build beautiful profile with progress(meh).
   
    
  The need for the project :
  
    It is hard to lose weight with this amount of resturants arround you ,it's hard to know how much weight you gained, how much calories you have
    burnt ,this app provides a simple solution.
    
    It's needed by :
    
    - Athelets and players
    - Elders with diabetes and cholestrol.
    - Everyone.
    
  Existing Systems And Tech :
   
     An example of this application is the famous web application ```myfitnesspal```. 
     This application contains some of the ideas we are using in this app but obviously simpler version.

 Tools and Resources :

    - HTML/CSS for Frontend
    - NodeJS, ExpressJS for backend
    - MongoDB for the database.
    - Open Food API to search for food.
    - More to be added later in the ```requirements and dependencies```.
   
   
 Scope of the project :
    
        Main actors of the system 
         
          - the user of the app 
          - the food & the calories     
              
        The user of the app
        
          * Create an account
          * Provide some info to help us track his status 
          * Choose the food with a reasonable amount of calories

        The food & the calories 
        
          * each ingrediant contains a nomber of calories
          * counter count the no-of-calories per day 

        The auth part.
          
          * json
          * More
       
       
 Feasibility study
   
    Financial feasibility :
    
     since it is a web application and a pounch of studens are designing it no cost for the staff 
     the application will follow the freeware software standards, low bandwidth is required
     all the initial stages will be free abviously 
     -at first we will choose some of related friends and family test the app give us feedbacks 
     then next stage we will widen the circle of the clints and when it is decided that the application is ready for 
     the ordinary user to use we are announcing the application to the public 

     from that the project is financially feasible

    
    Technical feasibility :
    
      - check out : Tools and Resources
     
      
       
    
Resources feasibility :

     - programming devices *laptops*
     - hosting space 
     - programming tools 
     - programmers (really !!)

   
Risk feasibility :
    
    - The auth system might not be so secure, 
    - SQL injection (maybe)

      
Users of the project ::
    
    - Anyone
        
    
Considerations 
  
    performance

      The increasing of the number of users will not affect the performance(or will)
      The poor backend design may affect the speed of data transfering.
      
      * query and reporting time : not yet
      * throughput : not yet  
      * storage : clould/Server Side

  
  
  Security
  
    - Authentication is required to login
    - The user activity will be recorded *only for safety*

  
  
  Availablity 
   
    The system will be available as long as you have an internet connection, or it's not ddosed.


   
  Maintability
   
     in this application the engineers uses thir background of oop and rup to design this web application
     ,the application is well structured and designed to simulate a very famous website
